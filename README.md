The Government Hospitals of our country do not have a proper organized online appointment system for patients.​
The existing appointment system does not give the scheduled time to visit the doctor. It only provides the date.​
We plan to rectify the same and reduce the difficulty faced by both hospitals as well as the public.​
The problem selected by our group is to build an appointment system for Government Hospitals in our country.​
Our objective is to build an appointment system for the patients to ease the consultation process. Along with the appointment, the scheduled time for visiting the doctor will also be given. ​
There is an option to view the appointment once the user logs in. This option shows the appointment details along with the scheduled time of appointment.​
An option is also provided to cancel the appointment. ​
If anyone of the user cancels the appointment, the scheduled time for the other users will be modified and notified to the respective users.​
